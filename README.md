This project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree explores AirBnB Boston housing data to answer three questions of interest. 

***AirBnB Housing Dataset Exploration***

1. **Installations**

    - Uses Python 3.0
    
    - Other libraries used:
    
        - Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
        - Numpy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
        - Sci-Kit Learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
        - Keras: https://keras.io


2. **Project Motivation**

This project was completed in compliance with the requirements of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. 

In it, I intended to explore the AirBnB Boston Housing dataset along three questions that I formulated myself. To answer these questions, I used data science and machine learning knowledge. 


3. **File Descriptions**
	1. Notebook:
	
		1. AirBnB Boston Housing Dataset Exploration.ipynb
		
	2. Data: 
	
		1. boston_listings.csv: Comma-Separated file with information on Boston AirBnB listings.
		2. boston_reviews.csv: Comma-Separated file with reviews for boston listings. 
		
		3. positive-words.txt: Text file with list of positive words. 
		4. negative-words.txt: Text file with list of negative words.
		
	3. Other:
	
		1. best_weights.hdf5: Best weights of trained MLP model during training. 


4. **Instructions**
